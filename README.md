# DimXI
This tweak lets you dim your iPhone or iPad screen below the minimum brightness by adding a black screen overlay with variable opacity. It is very useful if you like to use your phone at night.

It also gets you a control center module for toggling it.

## Build
You need to follow the instruction in [CCSupport wiki](https://github.com/opa334/CCSupport/wiki) in order to build `controlcenter` project.
